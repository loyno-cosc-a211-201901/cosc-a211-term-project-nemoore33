Final Project Presentation
Script for Demonstration

My project is a conversion tool to do conversions between metric and standard measurements.
The program consists on many if statements based on the user’s responses to
•	Whether the user is measuring length or volume
•	Whether the user is going from metric to standard or standard to metric
•	Base of the starting measurement
•	Base of the ending measurement
So, now I am going to begin the actual demonstration
ask the audience
Are we going to convert length or volume?
audience picks either length or volume
Okay, so is this conversion going from metric to standard or standard to metric?
audience picks either s-m or m-s volume
What is the base of our starting measurement?
audience tells me base
What is the base of our ending measurement?
audience tells me base
So finally, what is our actual measurement in whole numbers only?
Audience tells me measurement
Okay so the program tells us that (starting measurement and base)  is (ending measurement and base)
Through creating this project, I learned that I knew more about programming than I thought I did.
Because we proposed our projects at the beginning of the year, I started to get nervous that I wouldn’t know how to execute the program by the end of the semester, but I did!
Also, while creating this program, I really learned the importance of compiling at EVERY step because I started over many times because I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my program.
Finally, I learned I really like programming and it surprisingly is really helpful in the field of neuroscience (which is my major) and even though I am not the best at programming, I chose to add it as a minor. 
The end.
